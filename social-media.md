🚀 CONNECTING THE DOTS: PyTorch for Financial Derivatives - Computing Greeks via Automatic Differentiation

After peeking at the intersection of machine learning and quantitative finance, I asked #ClaudeCode to create a package that demonstrates something remarkable (one upon a time, & to this day): THE SAME MATH that trains neural networks can compute financial Greeks!

💡 THE KEY INSIGHT:
Whether you're training a deep learning model (1986), computing derivative sensitivities in finance (2006), or optimizing quantum circuits (2018+), you're using REVERSE-MODE AUTOMATIC DIFFERENTIATION. It's all connected! Realizing these insights was revolutionary. 🔄

📊 WHAT'S INCLUDED:
✓ Production-ready Python code for pricing European, Asian, Basket, and Barrier options
✓ Automatic Greeks computation (Delta, Gamma, Vega, etc.) - NO manual derivatives needed
✓ Interactive Jupyter notebooks with visualizations
✓ Complete history from backpropagation to "Smoking Adjoints" to modern frameworks
✓ Quantum machine learning examples with PennyLane
✓ One-command setup script for instant environment creation

🎯 THE PERFORMANCE:
• 17x FASTER than finite difference methods
• EXACT derivatives (machine precision, not approximations)
• 10-100x speedup with GPU acceleration
• ALL Greeks computed in ONE backward pass

🔬 PERFECT FOR:
• Quantitative analysts exploring ML frameworks
• ML practitioners interested in finance applications
• Anyone curious about differentiable programming
• Educators teaching computational finance or automatic differentiation

📚 EDUCATIONAL VALUE:
The package includes an introduction to differentiable programming that connects:
• Backpropagation for neural networks (Rumelhart, Hinton, Williams 1986)
• Adjoint methods for Greeks (Giles & Glasserman 2006 - "Smoking Adjoints")
• Quantum circuit optimization (PennyLane 2018+)

This isn't just about finance or ML - it's about understanding a FUNDAMENTAL COMPUTATIONAL PARADIGM that has transformed multiple fields.

What once required specialized C++ expertise and some mathematics is now accessible through 10 lines of Python. That's the power of modern automatic differentiation frameworks!
